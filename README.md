SHOULD NOT BE HERE
### Preparing your commit

- Choose which Files to Stage
- Choose which Lines to Stage
- Concise descriptive and specific message (you can add details in the description)
- [Optional] Amend you last commit if you need to (and avoid duplicates)

### Clean up the Mess behind you

Mistakes are common. Git is here to help you clean up the mess.

You might need to:

- Ignore a commit (erase it from history) ⇒ drop or reset
- Move one or several commits to another branch ⇒ cherry-pick or reset
- Change the whole history (change order, rename, squash…) ⇒ interactive rebase
