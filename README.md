### Branch Manipulation

### Creation and Tracking

Note: *I like to do these operations with the command-line but you could do it in Fork.*

```bash
# Creating a Branch and Variation

## Creating a new branch locally
git checkout -b feature/app_structure

## Start Tracking a branch that exists on remote
git fetch [origin]
git checkout feature/branch_that_exists_on_remote
